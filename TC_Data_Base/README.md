# About
Here are test cases regarding task I found during job searching. Task was: 
"Please tell us how would you test this form designed for adding and editing tables in a relational database."
All I got was the image of this form (to be find in here - form.img)

# Note - 
last page in the Test_Cases.pdf concerns question that I would ask during testing the form. Namely, is that blank column (marked red) 
is deliberately put there, or maybe it is a bug of the interface.
